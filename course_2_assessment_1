The textfile, travel_plans.txt, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable num.

with open('travel_plans.txt','r') as op:
    num=0
    for i in op.read():
        num+=1
    print(num)
    
    
    
    
 We have provided a file called emotion_words.txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable num_words.
 
 
 num_words = 0
with open("emotion_words.txt", 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        num_words += len(line.split())
        print(line.split())
print("number of words : ", num_words)    

Assign to the variable num_lines the number of lines in the file school_prompt.txt.

num_lines=0
with open('school_prompt.txt','r') as op:
    for i in op:
        num_lines+=1
    print(num_lines)
    
    
    
Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.

op=open('school_prompt.txt','a')
beginning_chars=op.read()[:30]


Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.

op=open('school_prompt.txt','a')
three=[]
f=op.readlines()
for i in f:
    k=i.split()
    three.append(k[2])
    
print(three)    


Challenge: Create a list called emotions that contains the first word of every line in emotion_words.txt.

emotions=[]
op=open('emotion_words.txt','a')
for i in op:
    k=i.split()
    emotions.append(k[0])
    
    
 Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars
 
 op=open('travel_plans.txt','r')
first_chars=op.read()[:33]



Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.

op=open('school_prompt.txt','r')
p_words=[]
for i in op:
    k=i.split()
    for i in k:
        if 'p' in i:
            p_words.append(i)
        else:
            pass
